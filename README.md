# Peval Testsets

[**Site**](https://peval.io) / [**ùïè**](https://x.com/fiveoutofnine)

Peval is an AI eval platform that assesses models using optimized prompts across various tasks and scenarios.
There are [ongoing competitions](https://peval.io) anyone can compete in by writing prompts to be evaluated.
As models improve and new techniques emerge, the prompts get more effective, which yields a benchmark that pushes models to their limits.

Currently, there is 1 type of competition:

1. **Competitions**: Prompts tested against a Q&amp;A-style test set.

## Competitions

Each Peval Competition has a **public** test-set to score submissions while it's ongoing and a **private** test-set to score submissions after end.
The following is a complete list of both test-set for each completed competition and the scripts used to generate them:

| Name                   | Test-set                                                                                                          | README                                                                                   | Peval                                                        |
