Peval is a competition and AI eval platform that benchmarks models using optimized prompts across various tasks and scenarios.
There are [ongoing competitions](https://peval.io) anyone can compete in by writing prompts to be evaluated.
As models and techniques improve, the prompts get more effective and push models to their limits.

Currently, there is 1 type of competition:

1. **Competitions**: Prompts tested against a Q&amp;A-style test set.

## Competitions

Each Peval Competition has a **public** test set to score submissions while it's ongoing and a **private** test set to score submissions after end.
The following is a complete list of both test set for each completed competition and the scripts used to generate them:
